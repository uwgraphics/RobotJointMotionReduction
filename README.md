For development/deployment of the code:

 - Clone the repo to your local machine

 - cd into the RobotJointMotionReduction folder

 - run `git submodule init` to initialize the git submodules that the app uses for a couple of dependencies

 - run `git submodule update` to update the git submodules

 - run `npm install` to install all npm dependencies

 - `npm start` to develop the app localy

### Warning

The program is built on [Motion Comparator]() and the UMAP graph is implemented using [React-Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js).

## Credits
Motion Projector draws a lot of design inspiration from robot visualization tools, especially [Foxglove Studio](https://github.com/foxglove/studio) and [Webviz](https://github.com/cruise-automation/webviz). The teaser image is generated by AI using NightCafe Studio.
